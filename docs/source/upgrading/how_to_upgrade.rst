How To Upgrade
==============

If you already have ``citrination-client`` installed (either in your virtual environment or your global set of ``pip`` packages), you can upgrade to v4.0.0 like this:


.. code-block:: python
    
    pip install --upgrade citrination-client

If you do this in an existing project, be sure to update your ``requirements.txt`` file to point to version 4.0.0.
