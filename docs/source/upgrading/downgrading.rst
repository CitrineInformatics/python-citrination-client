Downgrading to An Older Version
====================================

If you have accidentally installed the new version of PyCC and would like to downgrade to the most recent backwards-compatible version, run the following command:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install --force-reinstall citrination_client==3.4.0

If you used an even older version of PyCC, you can replace ``3.4.0`` with whatever version you would like. To see all available versions of the package, use this command:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install citrination_client==
