Upgrading
---------

If you are using a version of PyCC older than 5.0.0 and would like to upgrade your scripts to the latest versions, please
note the following:

1. When building data views, you now have to specify upper and lower bounds.
2. When making certain prediction/design calls, things previously under `client.data_views` are now under `client.models`
3. You have to specify the subclient, e.g. `client.data.upload()` not just `client.upload()`
